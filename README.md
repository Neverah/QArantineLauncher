The QArantineLauncher is a QA Automation tool that aims to facilitate the use of the tests developed with the [QArantine Test Framework](https://github.com/Neverah/QArantine), as well as the build and publish processes of the projects in which it has been applied, automating the generation and testing pipeline of local versions.

It allows to unify the management of several projects in the same application, which provides Clean, Build, Publish and Test steps that can be executed independently or in a consecutive pipeline to quickly build and validate versions locally, among other tools.

Note: I'm developing this project coupled to a private indie videogame project with more collaborators, so I just copy the progress here when I reach certain milestones. This is not the main repository where I develop the project, but a sample of the code. QArantine needs a project to be coupled to take advantage of most features.

As a preview, this is how the GUI of the main QArantineLauncher functionalities looks like when running:
